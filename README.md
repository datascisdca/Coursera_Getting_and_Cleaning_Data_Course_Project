All the data is present in the same folder and un-compressed.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains the code to perform the analyses described in five steps. 

The output file of the 5th step is called averages_data.txt, which is a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
